# python_for_ds

Welcome to the "Python Libraries for Data Science" course repository! 
This course is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills to effectively use essential Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

## Course Overview

- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Course Goal:** By the end of this course, you'll be able to handle various types of data, create meaningful visualizations, build and deploy basic machine learning models, and develop end-to-end data-driven solutions using industry-standard tools.
- **Topics Covered:** 
  - NumPy and Pandas
  - Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
  - Text Data Processing
  - Working with APIs
  - Neural Networks with TensorFlow/PyTorch
  - Image Data Processing with OpenCV
  - Deployment and Integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should be familiar with the following Python concepts:
- Basic syntax and structure
- Data types and structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Writing and using functions
- File handling (reading and writing files)
- Basic understanding of Python libraries and modules

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Placeholder for datasets (raw, processed, and external).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each week's code examples and practical labs.
- `src/`: Source code for reusable functions and modules.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vladbandurin/Python4DS.git
   cd https://github.com/vladbandurin/Python4DS.git
